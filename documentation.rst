Documenting code and projects
=============================


It's generally a good idea to make sure that you document your code.
Whether you expect to be the only person using it, or you're writing it for a wider audience, making it clear what the code is meant to do, how it does it, and how you use it is an important part of the software development process.

It's generally a good idea to make sure you set some time aside to document your code as you go along, and this document will discuss some of the tools which can make this easier.

.. note:: This section uses Python as its example langauge and development environment. However, documentation tools exist for all languages which you're likely to encounter.
