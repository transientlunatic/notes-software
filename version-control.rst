Version Control
===============

When writing code, in any language, it can be useful to make sure that you have a way of keeping track of how the entire codebase changes over time.
Specialised software for managing the process of tracking these changes are called **version control systems**.
There are a number of different systems available, but in these notes I'll focus on one called ``git``, which has come to dominate both the world of scientific computing and the more general open-source software community in the last decade.

Most version control systems follow similar principles, however ``git`` possesses some idiosyncracies which other systems don't have.
Some of these are by design, and some of these are a result of its own history.
I'll try and note situations where ``git`` does something unusual or potentially confusing as we go along, and try to justify (where I can) why it does things that way.

If you're starting a new project I **strongly** recommend using ``git`` to operate its source control.
You may, however, encounter older systems if you're working with an older codebase (though even then many of these are moving to use ``git`` thanks to widespread community support, and websites like Gitlab and Github, which I'll talk more about later).

.. note::
   Before we go on, if you need to find out something about ``git`` which isn't covered in these notes (and there are *many* things about ``git`` which are beyond their scope) you can find the excellent Git book free online: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
   Printed copies can also be purchased from Apress.



What is version control?
------------------------

(And why do I need it?)

Most modern version control systems are designed to make it easier for teams of people to work on the same large codebase at the same time, but that's not the only situation they're useful for.
Take an example: you're working on a piece of code (or maybe event a document [or a thesis!]) and you make some changes.
You then go away for a while, and a few weeks later you discover those changes have had some unintended consequence, and you wish you were able to just hit an undo button and go back to what happened before.
Well, this is what version control, at its most fundamental level, is designed to do.
When you register a file with a version control system it starts keeping track of the changes which you make to the file, and it lets you step back to previous points in the history of the file.
You can think about it like adding a time-dimension to your computer's file system.
This extra functionality also lets us do a number of other neat things, which we'll come to later in these notes.

There are two important concepts which are worth introducing at this point which will make understanding Git and similar VCSs easier: *repositories*, and *commits*.

repository
   This is just a directory on your file system where Git, or a similar VCS is keeping track of the history of some files.
   Not all directories on your machine will be held under version control, only ones inside directories which you turn into repositories.

commit
   This is a defined point in the history of a file; effectively a snapshot of its state at a specific time.
   VCSs like Git allow you to step between commits of the file in order to explore its history.


Getting started with your first repository
------------------------------------------

There are two ways that you might want to get started with a repository, either setting one up for the first time, or getting a copy of someone else's repository.
In this section I'll cover how you make your own repository, and discuss "cloning" someone else's repository later.

Before we can make a repository, however, we'll need some once-off preparation to set git up on your machine (and you'll need to do this on every machine which you use).

.. note::
   At the moment all of these notes assume that you'll be using Git on a unix-like system, such as MacOS X or some breed of Linux.
   I'll try and put together notes for using Git on Windows 10 at some point in the future.

To get started you'll need to open a terminal. We can check that you have Git installed by running

.. code-block:: console

		$ git --version
		git version 2.17.1

If you get an error, such as ``Command 'git' not found`` then you'll need to install git.
This will be different on various different systems, but again the Git book comes to our rescue with its `installation instructions`_ section.

If running ``git --version`` worked we can go ahead with setup, which involves telling Git who you are, and your email address.
This is important, as commits in the repository will be associated with you so that it's possible to tell who made changes to the code.

Run these two lines in your console (replacing the appropriate details) to finish setting this up:

.. code-block:: console

		$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
		$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

You can also find additional `git setup`_ options in the Git book, but this is all we need for now.

Now, say I keep all of my coding projects in a subdirectory called ``projects`` inside my home directory, and I want to start a new project called ``antelope``. Then I'd start by making a directory for it inside the ``projects`` directory, as so:

.. code-block:: console

		$ cd ~/projects
		$ mkdir antelope
		
To make the ``antelope`` directory into a repository all we need to do is ``cd`` into it, and run ``git init``:

.. code-block:: console

		$ cd antelope
		$ git init

And that's it! We have our first repository.


Keeping track of files
----------------------

Now that we have a repository it would be useful to start keeping track of files and their changes.
Let's start by making a new file inside our repository (which lives in ``~/projects/antelope``, remember).

.. code-block:: console

		$ echo "Hello world" > test.txt

We now have our text file which contains the words "Hello world".

Now, remember that I said Git works by effectively "adding a time dimension to the filesystem"? Well, that's true to some extent, but the timesteps are discrete, so we need to define what a single point in time will look like.
To do this Git looks at the repository the last time a commit was made, and then looks at all of the changes which have happened since then **to the files we tell it to look at**.
This last bit is important, because Git has a step called "staging" where all of the changes to be made to the repository are assembled before a new commit is made [staging-hg]_.
To tell Git to prepare to add a file, or updates to a file to the repository we run ``git add`` like so:

.. code-block:: console

		$ git add test.txt

This new file will now be in the stage, ready to be made into the commit.
We can verify that this has happened using the ``git status`` command:

.. code-block:: console

		$ git status
		
		On branch master

		No commits yet

		Changes to be committed:
		(use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

		new file:   test.txt

We can see that ``test.txt`` has been listed as a new file ready to be committed.

Let's make this change into a commit, so that we can always come back to this point.
The Git stage can be turned into a commit using the ``git commit`` command. It's *always* a good idea to write a little description of what the commit was for when we make a commit, which is done with the ``-m`` flag. So we can run

.. code-block:: console

		$ git commit -m "Added a test file."
		[master (root-commit) 1e9f762] Added a test file.
		1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
		create mode 100644 test.txt

And our changes (our new file) are now stored in the repository.
We can see the history of the repository by running ``git log`` which will show us the list of all commits.

.. code-block:: console

		$ git log
		commit 1e9f762c2b8cdb7315b21ad7fbb3a50999520ce1 (HEAD -> master)
		Author: Daniel Williams <daniel.williams@glasgow.ac.uk>
		Date:   Thu Oct 8 15:45:01 2020 +0100

		Added a test file.

As we make more changes the log will get more fleshed-out!

Suppose we want to change the contents of ``test.txt``, and then update the repository with the new contents of the file.
Well, we can do that exactly the same way as before!

.. code-block:: console

		$ echo "This is a second line." >> test.txt
		$ git add test.txt
		$ git commit -m "Added a second line."
		[master 7ae87f1] Added a second line.
		1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
		$ git log
		commit 7ae87f1e78d213bedc0ad81b32588ee6496e1dfa (HEAD -> master)
		Author: Daniel Williams <mail@daniel-williams.co.uk>
		Date:   Thu Oct 8 16:18:26 2020 +0100

		Added a second line.

		commit 1e9f762c2b8cdb7315b21ad7fbb3a50999520ce1
		Author: Daniel Williams <mail@daniel-williams.co.uk>
		Date:   Thu Oct 8 15:45:01 2020 +0100

		Added a test file.


Working with remote repositories
--------------------------------

One of the very attractive features of ``git`` and other *distributed* version control systems is the ease with which you can access code over a network or the internet.
For example, if you want to get a copy of the repository which contains the source for these notes all you need to do is run

.. code-block:: console

		$ git clone https://github.com/transientlunatic/notes-software.git

Which will copy the repository into a directory called ``notes-software``.
The repository will automatically be a fully initialised git repository too.

When a repository is cloned this way ``git`` keeps a record of where it came from; by default the repository you cloned from will be called the ``origin`` repository.
You can have ``git`` track numerous "remote" repositories, but for now we'll stick to just the default.

You can see the list of remotes on a given repository by running

.. code-block:: console

   $ git remote show
   origin

In this case ``origin`` is the only remote repository, and we can see some additional information by running

.. code-block:: console

		$ git remote show origin

		* remote origin
		  Fetch URL: git@github.com:transientlunatic/notes-software.git
		  Push  URL: git@github.com:transientlunatic/notes-software.git
		  HEAD branch: master
		  Remote branch:
		    master tracked
		  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
		    master merges with remote master
		  Local ref configured for 'git push':
		    master pushes to master (up-to-date)

For now don't worry about what all of this means; right now the ``Fetch URL`` and ``Push URL`` fields should make sense though, as the location of the repository, which is on the internet in this case.

Fetching and pulling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we've introduced repositories which live in other places, there is the possibility that the repository will have received new commits either from yourself or a collaborator.
To download those changes, and to learn about their existence git uses a mechanism called a "fetch".

So, if I wanted to download new commits from the remote repository ``origin`` I would run

.. code-block:: console

		$ git fetch origin

Git will then go and check the remote repository for changes, and download those to my local machine.
Importantly, running a ``git fetch`` gets new data, but it doesn't attempt to update the current state of your local repository.

The current state of your repository is known as its ``HEAD``.
By default this will be the most recent commit in your repository, but as we'll see in due course we can move it to different places.

When we want to incorporate code from the remote repository into the current state of the repository we need to use a ``git pull``, which fetches the remote data and then merges it into your own repository.
You can do this by running

.. code-block:: console

		$ git pull origin master

Here ``master`` is the name of the "branch" which you want to pull from.
I'll cover branching in more detail later, but every repository has at least one branch, which is normally called ``master`` by default.

.. sidebar:: ``main`` vs ``master``

	     It's becoming increasingly common to call the primary branch in a repository ``main`` rather than ``master``, partly in response to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, but also because it's more descriptive.
	     You can check the name of your local branch by running ``$ git branch``.

	     I've included notes at the end of this chapter on how to change the defaul name of the primary branch on your own ``git`` installation as well.

If you've not made any changes to your repository compared to those already present this process is simple, and is known as a "fast-forward".
Things can become a little trickier if you've made changes on your repository too.
It's generally a good idea to make sure you've committed any changes you've made to files before running a git pull.

There are two possible scenarios which can occur here.
In the first ``git`` is able to successfully work-out how to combine your changes and the changes in the remote repository.
An example of this happening would be if two different files had been changed, and there was no ambiguity about which changes should be kept.

If your merge is this kind ``git`` will make the necessary changes automatically, and it will produce a new commit with the completed merge, and will ask you to provide a commit message.


Adding a remote to a local repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've clone a remote repository then ``git`` will automatically establish a relationship between the remote repository and your local copy.
In ``git`` parlance the repository you cloned is called a "remote", and by default it's given the name ``origin``.

If you made a repository on your own machine, however, and now you want to push it to a remote location (say you've just made an empty repository on a service like Github), you'll need to tell ``git`` about the relationship.
Fortunately this just involves one command, and all you need is the url for the remote repository.

.. codeblock:: console

	       $ git remote add <remote name> <remote url>

For example, if you wanted to add the repository for these notes as the remote called ``origin`` on a repository:

.. codeblock:: console

	       $ git remote add origin https://github.com/transientlunatic/notes-software.git

.. sidebar:: Multiple remotes

	     We can have multiple remote repositories which we can push to and pull from, each with a different name.
	     This can be useful if you need to maintain a repository in both an institutional and a public server.

Pushing
~~~~~~~

When we have changes in our repository which we want to see reflected in a remote repository we need to use a ``git push`` to copy them to the remote.
A ``git push`` will copy local commits to a remote in the same way that a ``git pull`` copies them from the remote to your local copy.
The main difference is that a ``git push`` can't merge changes (strategies to cope with this are discussed in the `git-merge <section on merging>`_).

The command to push changes on the ``main`` branch to a remote called ``origin``  is

.. codeblock:: console

	       $ git push origin main

Now, you see to push to a given remote we need to specify it in the ``git push`` command.
However, we can set a specific remote and branch as the default push location, using the ``--set-upstream`` flag during a git push.
To set the ``main`` branch on ``origin`` to be the default push and pull location run

.. codeblock:: console

	       $ git push --set-upstream origin main

or alternatively, use the short-hand ``-u``:

.. codeblock:: console

	       $ git push -u origin main

.. _[staging-hg]: This is in fact a slightly peculiar feature of Git, and other version control systems, like Mercurial, don't do this, and they'll make the new commit from everything which exists in the working directory. This is simpler, but it can make it harder to make it easy to follow what's going on if there are changes to lots of files, where multiple commits might be helpful. Either way, this is how Git does things, and like it or not, it's what we need to work with.
