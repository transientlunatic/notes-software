This repository contains notes on using various software engineering practices in conjunction with writing code for scientific research.

Software engineering and research have many differences, some of which are genuine, and some of which are related to the status which the written code has in each discipline.
Often for us scientists the "final product" is a research paper rather than a stable piece of software.
However, there is value to be had in writing maintainable and reproducable scientific code.
