Testing your code
=================

Suppose you collaborate on writing code: how do you make sure none of your collaborators break your code? The answer: introduce quality controls.
We can do this by testing the code frequently.
To make sure you do this (and do it consistently), we should automate this process, so that we can make sure it happens every time that the code is committed to your repository.
